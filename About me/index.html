  <h1 class="page-title">Hi, I hope you're doing well.</h1>
  
  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">I come from a rural town that sits on the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains in Northern India. 
    I grew up in the farms and led a simple childhood. Looking at the night sky during moonless nights
    from the fields were one of best days of my childhood. 
  </p>

  <p>I have always wanted to study stars and twinkling things. I went to my local high school where I read 
    Math and Science. I was growing and it was my senior year when I had my first crush. She taught me the 
    importance of love and how it matters beyond anything else. I remember writing my first short story about 
    this girl and how my English teacher read that in front of the whole class. Such a wonderful memory!
  </p>

  <p>I went to a university near my hometown and did my bachelor's there. During this 
    time, I experienced pretty much everything; from loosing a loved one to acing several competitions. Life
    was teaching me and I kept on learning. But my love for the shimmering night sky never faded. I applied for the master's 
    program at UMass Dartmouth, got accepted and came to this foreign land, thousands of miles from family 
    and friends. It was hard leaving the place I grew up. But then, we all have to leave our comfort zones and 
    work hard on achieving our dreams. So here I am now, studying stars and living the best in me everyday.
  </p>

    <figcaption style="font-size:15px; text-align: center;"><em>Someday, Somewhere </em></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>I make mistakes. I get angry sometimes. I have lost friends. I have lost love. So, you see my journey 
    has been an ordinary one. It is very humbling when you realize that you are just someone. One of the very 
    best things that I have done is to fall in love with myself. I accept my deficits and always try to 
    build from that, one little step at a time. I am not perfect and will never be. ÃŸBut I can always keep pushing
    myself to be just the person I have always looked up to. A simple, ordinary guy who wants to read and learn all 
    that there is. And live in a moss laden wooden cabin, near a river, somewhere in the mountains.
