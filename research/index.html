<p>My research focuses on stellar physics and stellar evolution.
  I create tools and insights that allow better understanding of formation and evolution of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and 
  stellar-mass black holes) and the various associated
  transient events (e.g., supernovae). There is a lot of new data coming in from
  missions like Kepler and TESS (with PLATO to come) which could reveal the properties of stellar interiors.
  Surveys like ZTF and ASAS-SN (with LSST on the horizon) will uncover fainter, faster, and rarer populations of
  transient phenomena. Gaia has measured the parallax, proper motion, and color of more than a billion stars. 
  This astronomical amount data can also be efficiently and accurately handled using novel Deep learning techniques which 
  vastly reduce computational time and resource.
  This is a very exciting time to be in the field of Stellar Astrophysics.

  Mostly, I am developing Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solvers to build numerical solutions for SN Ia. MHD plays an
  important role in the long term evolution of white dwarf mergers and can lead us to better
  understand their progenitor systems.
  My current effort involves a direct comparison of the fully MHD solution of a white dwarf 
   merger versus that obtained for an alpha disk hydrodynamic treatment. Much of the current 
   literature is still based upon the latter, in which the differential rotation in the tidally
   disrupted disk leads to a hot inflated envelope in the merger, which expands
   dramatically to non-degenerate stellar radii, in strong contrast to the MHD merger which remains
   compact.

  I am also interested in solving astrophysical problems using machine learning. I am developing and
  and training a Convolutional Neural Network on supernova spectra data from Berkeley SN Ia Program.
  The main objective is to reduce the supernova classification time from hours (template
  matching methods) to seconds without compromising on accuracy. I have also implemented segmentation
  methods that allow for better feature recognition.

<p> I earned my bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from 
    <a href = "https://www.upes.ac.in/">UPES </a> where my advisor was Dr 
    <a href = "https://drguven.com/">Ugur Guven. </a>
    My undergraduate thesis concerned the orbital analysis of  
    trajectories of objects under influence of a gravitational source. I built on transfer
    algorithms like Hohmann and modified them using RK4 scheme for interpolation. I created a machine 
    learning algorithm that trained itself in real-time on data produced by the orbital 
    analysis module which led to a ML based collision avoidance system. I also extended the solver to 
    include effects like orbital decay, albedo and third body perturbations. I am particularly proud of
    my work because it went on to influence a bunch of other computer science students who 
    then added elements of neural network in the solver and developed an orbital collision avoidance system.
