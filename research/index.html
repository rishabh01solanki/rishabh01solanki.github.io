<p>I am interested in understanding the fundamental physical 
  processes that govern the formation and evolution of celestial objects. In recent 
  years, the field of astrophysics has seen a number of significant developments, 
  such as the discovery of exoplanets and the detection of gravitational waves, which 
  have expanded our knowledge of the universe. Multimessenger astronomy has also played 
  a crucial role in allowing us to study celestial events in unprecedented detail by 
  combining data from multiple observatories and instruments. In my own research, I have 
  focused on topics such as the evolution of compact objects such as white dwarfs and the 
  role of magnetic fields in celestial events. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the 
  ongoing effort to improve our understanding of the cosmos and to address fundamental questions 
  about the nature of the universe.
  </p>

<p>
  I am building upon a novel Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver  (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-010-0289-4">Bouchut et al, 2010</a>) 
  to get numerical solutions for White Dwarf (WD) mergers. MHD plays an
  important role in the long term evolution of these mergers and can lead us to better
  understand their progenitor systems.
  My current effort involves a direct comparison of the fully MHD solution of a WD 
   merger versus that obtained for an alpha disk hydrodynamic treatment. Much of the previous 
   literature (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1973A%26A....24..337S/ADS_PDF">Shakura and Sunyaev, 1973</a>) 
   is still based upon the latter, in which the differential rotation in the tidally
   disrupted disk leads to a hot inflated envelope in the merger, which expands
   dramatically to non-degenerate stellar radii, in strong contrast to the MHD merger which remains
   compact. We are clarifying the thermal structure of fully magnetized white dwarf mergers , and comparing 
   these to smoothly heated models given by the alpha disk prescription.

  I am also interested in solving astrophysical problems using machine learning. I am developing and
  and training a Convolutional Neural Network on supernova spectra data from Berkeley SN Ia Program.
  The main objective is to reduce the supernova classification time from hours (template
  matching methods) to seconds without compromising on accuracy. I have also implemented segmentation
  methods that allow for better feature recognition.
</p>


<p> I earned my bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from 
    <a href = "https://www.upes.ac.in/">UPES </a> where my advisor was Dr 
    <a href = "https://drguven.com/">Ugur Guven. </a>
    My undergraduate thesis concerned the N-body simulations using Monte Carlo methods. I also worked on building orbital transfer
    algorithms (Hohmann) and modified them using RK4 scheme for interpolation. I created a machine 
    learning algorithm that trained itself in real-time on data produced by the orbital 
    analysis module which led to a ML based collision avoidance system. I also extended the solver to 
    include effects like orbital decay, albedo and third body perturbations. I am particularly proud of
    my work because it went on to influence a bunch of other computer science students who 
    then added elements of neural network in the solver and developed an orbital collision avoidance system.
