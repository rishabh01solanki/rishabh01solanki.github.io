<h2 class="page-title">A Deep Neural Network to identify numbers</h2>
<span class="post-date">June 28, 2022</span>

<p>It is absurdly easy for us to recognise numbers and patterns. However, given this task to 
  a machine, it fails terribly. Computers are really good for crunching numbers and in a very 
  short time. They are able to perform iterative tasks with consistency and accuracy. But 
  where they fall short is when they have to use their bias to, say, identify a number or tell 
  green from red. It is because machines have no bias of their own. They do what we tell them to do. 
  However, with the advancement of Machine learning, this picture has now changed and computers 
  are now able to classify and categories objects. With Deep Neural Network, a machine can somewhat replicate
  the behaviour and workings of a human brain.

  Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a multi layer network that roughly works the same way as a 
  human brain. It has neurons, activators, links and weights. There is an input node layer, a hidden 
  node layer and and an output node layer. All these are connected via some links and these links 
  have weights attached to them. The link weights can be updated by training the model which can be 
  done in two ways, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The former is more simple and more
  reliable as it is based on teaching a model what exactly are they operating on. It is just like
  a toddler who is interacting with the environment and the parents are constantly teaching the kid
  how to interact and interpret.

<h3>
    Neural Network for recognising numbers
</h3>

<p>
    I made this basic model using <a href="https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/">MNIST dataset. </a> 
    A picture of a handwritten number is composed of pixels (28x28). These pixels have some values
    associated with them. For simplicity, a greyed out picture is taken in which each pixel value is 
    between 0 (Black) to 255 (white). These are then stored in a .csv file, and this is data that is in 
    MNSIT.
</p>

<p>
    We can easily use this data set to train our neural network. You can find the code 
    <a href="https://github.com/rishabh01solanki/ML_numbers">here</a>. Once the network is trained,
    we can test it by comparing a new input image. You will be surprised how good the network performs.
</p>

<h3>
    Backquerry, "Inside the mind of a Neural Network"
</h3>

<p>
    Once the network is trained meaning, its links weights are set, we can backquerry the network. 
    We can input our querry at the output nodes and see what result it generates at the input layer.
    The images of '2' and '9' as shown were obtained in this fashion. This is what a neural 
    network thinks how a 'Zero' looks like.
