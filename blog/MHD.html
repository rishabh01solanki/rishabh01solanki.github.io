  <h1 class="page-title">MHD and Accretion</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Dec 15, 2022</span>
  
  <p> 
    In the study of accretion disks, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) provides valuable insights into 
    the role that magnetic fields can play in the evolution of these structures. When matter falls 
    onto a compact object, such as a black hole or a neutron star, it forms an accretion disk, 
    which is a rotating structure of gas and plasma. The magnetic fields present in the accretion 
    disk can have a significant impact on its behavior.
</p>

<p> 
    One of the key ways in which MHD affects accretion is through the formation of spiral density 
    waves. In the presence of a magnetic field, the gas and plasma in the accretion disk can become 
    magnetized, and the magnetic forces can cause the gas to clump together and form spiral patterns. 
    These spiral density waves can transport angular momentum outward, allowing the material in the 
    accretion disk to move closer to the central object and eventually accrete onto it.
</p>

<h3>Angular momentum transport in accretion disks</h3>

<p> 
  Angular momentum transport is the process by which angular momentum is redistributed within a 
  system, such as an accretion disk. This is a crucial process in accretion disks, as it allows 
  matter to move inward towards the central object, such as a star or a black hole, and ultimately 
  form new objects.
</p>

<p> 
  One of the main mechanisms for angular momentum transport in accretion disks is through the 
  action of viscous forces. As gas and dust particles move within the disk, they experience 
  friction and drag, which causes them to lose angular momentum and move inward. This process 
  is known as viscous accretion, and it is one of the primary ways in which matter is able to 
  move from the outer regions of the disk towards the central object.
</p>

<p> 
  In many accretion disks, the gas and dust particles are ionized, 
  which means that they are charged and can be affected by magnetic fields. As the particles 
  move within the disk, they are subject to the Lorentz force, which can cause them to change 
  direction and lose angular momentum. This process, known as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, 
  is thought to be responsible for the so-called "alpha viscosity" observed in many accretion disks.
</p>

<p> 
  The importance of angular momentum transport in accretion disks can be seen in the formation 
  of stars and planetary systems. As matter moves inward within the disk, it begins to clump 
  together and form clumps and protostars. These protostars can then go on to form fully-fledged 
  stars, as well as planets, moons, and other objects. Without angular momentum transport, the 
  matter in the accretion disk would not be able to move inward, and the formation of new objects 
  would not be possible.
</p>


</p>
     Another way in which MHD affects accretion is through the formation of jets and outflows. In 
    some cases, the magnetic fields in the accretion disk can become strong enough to launch jets 
    of material outwards from the central object. These jets can carry away a significant amount 
    of mass and energy, and can have a major impact on the evolution of the accretion disk.
</p>

<p> 
    Overall, MHD plays a critical role in the behavior of accretion disks. The magnetic fields 
    present in these structures can affect their structure, their dynamics, and their evolution, 
    and a better understanding of MHD is essential for our understanding of accretion processes.
